📖 Once Upon a Business
========================
These are the card arts for a simple collaborative business storytelling game I cooked up

Play it here on PlayingCards.io : https://playingcards.io/r42gbz

🧑‍💼 Why This Works Well In Corporate Settings

-Encourages creative thinking about familiar environments

-Builds storytelling fluency for real business narratives (e.g., change, conflict, resolution)

-Low barrier for entry—fun, light-hearted, and collaborative

-Excellent for team-building, onboarding, or workshops on communication, leadership, or innovation

Admittedly it is a variant of the excellent Once Upon A Time card game but with a business setting as I was getting tired to having to say things like "ok, the troll is the line manager card and the enchanted sword is the spreadsheet -uh wait no, I think it's that's the golden goose"

🕹️Once Upon a Business – Gameplay Guide
=========================================
🎯 Objective

Tell a compelling (and possibly chaotic) business-themed story using your hand of cards. Be the first to play all your cards and end the story coherently — or at least hilariously.

🧩 Setup

Shuffle the full deck.

Deal 7 cards to each player (a mix of Characters, Events, Objects, Aspects, and optionally an Ending).

Set aside the remaining deck as a draw pile.

🔄 Turn Structure

1) Narrate the Story

The first player becomes the active storyteller.

Begin a workplace tale with a card (e.g., “Once upon a business... it was Q4, and the reorg was about to shake things up...”).

Play cards from your hand that fit organically into the story.

2) Play as Many Cards as You Can

You may play multiple cards on your turn, as long as they make narrative sense.

You are encouraged to build momentum — the goal is to use your cards by embedding them into the unfolding story.

3) End Your Turn

If you run out of ideas, pass your turn. When you pass:
→ Draw 1 new card from the deck
→ Discard 1 card from your hand (swap action)

4) Interruptions (Optional Rule)

Any player may interrupt the active storyteller if they have a card that logically fits with what is being said.

The interrupter becomes the new active player and continues the story from there.

5) Challenges

If the group agrees that the story has become incoherent, repetitive, or inconsistent, they may issue a challenge.

If the challenge is upheld (majority vote), the current storyteller:
→ Must end their turn immediately and pass to the next player
→ And draw 1 card as a penalty

🏁 Ending the Story

If you have an Ending card, you may play it when the story reaches a satisfying or ironic conclusion.

You can’t force an ending — it has to feel earned (or at least funny).

If no one has (or plays) an Ending card, the story continues until a player runs out of cards and improvises a convincing finish.

🏆 Winning

The first player to use all their cards and bring the story to a logical or entertaining conclusion wins.

Or just embrace the chaos — the real win is creating a corporate fable you’ll be laughing about later.

Example Business "Tale"
=======================

🧑‍💼 Once Upon a Business...

The Transformation Lead 🔄 was parachuted into the company just weeks after The Newly Acquired Team 🤝 joined from a regional merger.

Morale was mixed. They had inherited a bloated Tech Debt List 🧱 and a rigid Employee Handbook 📘 that hadn’t been updated since the pre-cloud era.

To turn things around, the lead championed a bold new value: being Empowering 💪. “We’re not just fixing systems,” she declared. “We’re fixing how we think.”

But change didn’t come easy. The company’s obsession with Data-Driven decisions 📊 meant every action needed a spreadsheet to justify it — including how many coffee pods to order.

Then came the Quarterly Results Miss 📉. Not entirely unexpected, but it stung.

So the Transformation Lead called for The All-Hands Meeting 📣 of all meetings. One where slides were banned and only stories were shared.

And as voices filled the room — from engineers to HR — a shift began to happen...

Now It's Your Turn ! What happens next? Do they overcome resistance? Or spiral into another layer of bureaucracy?


🎮Variant Gameplay Modes
=========================
Sarcastic Mode: Everything goes wrong. Endings are ironic.

Change Management Mode: Players represent different departments trying to tell the best spin on the story.

Consultant vs Internal: Divide into roles (e.g., external consultants vs internal staff) and try to influence the narrative in your favour.
