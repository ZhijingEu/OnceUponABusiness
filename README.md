📖 Once Upon a Business
========================
These are the card arts for a simple collaborative business storytelling game I cooked up

Play it here on PlayingCards.io : https://playingcards.io/r42gbz

🧑‍💼 Why This Works Well In Corporate Settings

-Encourages creative thinking about familiar environments

-Builds storytelling fluency for real business narratives (e.g., change, conflict, resolution)

-Low barrier for entry—fun, light-hearted, and collaborative

-Excellent for team-building, onboarding, or workshops on communication, leadership, or innovation

Admittedly it is a variant of the excellent Once Upon A Time card game but with a business setting as I was getting tired to having to say things like "ok, the troll is the line manager card and the enchanted sword is the spreadsheet -uh wait no, I think it's that's the golden goose"

Once Upon a Business – Gameplay Guide
=====================================
🎯 Objective
Tell a compelling (and possibly chaotic) business-themed story using your hand of cards. Be the first to play all your cards and end the story coherently — or at least hilariously.

🧩 Setup
Shuffle the full deck.
Deal 8 cards to each player (a mix of Characters, Events, Objects, Aspects, and optionally an Ending).
Set aside the remaining deck as a draw pile.

🔄 Turn Structure
Narrate the Story
The first player becomes the storyteller.
Begin a workplace tale (e.g., “At the quarterly town hall, the CFO announced…”).
As you narrate, play cards from your hand that fit naturally into the story.

Play Cards
Cards must be integrated meaningfully — no rattling off cards without context!
You can play as many cards on your turn as you can justify through your narration.

End Your Turn
When you're out of ideas or cards to play, pass to the next player.
The next player must continue the same story, building on what’s come before.

🔁 Interruptions (Optional Rule)
If another player hears a perfect opportunity to play one of their cards (e.g. “Budget Cut” right after someone mentions overspending), they can interrupt.
They must take over the story immediately and continue for at least a few sentences before passing the turn.

🏁 Ending the Story
If a player has an Ending card, they may play it only when the story feels complete.
The story must feel like it wraps up logically — “And that's how we launched the product that saved the company.”
If no Ending card is played, the tale continues until someone runs out of cards and improvises a satisfying close.

🏆 Winning
The first player to use all their cards and bring the story to a fitting close wins.
Alternatively, just enjoy the ride — the real win is laughing through an absurdly realistic corporate saga.

Example Business "Tale"
=======================

🧑‍💼 Once Upon a Business...

The Transformation Lead 🔄 was parachuted into the company just weeks after The Newly Acquired Team 🤝 joined from a regional merger.

Morale was mixed. They had inherited a bloated Tech Debt List 🧱 and a rigid Employee Handbook 📘 that hadn’t been updated since the pre-cloud era.

To turn things around, the lead championed a bold new value: being Empowering 💪. “We’re not just fixing systems,” she declared. “We’re fixing how we think.”

But change didn’t come easy. The company’s obsession with Data-Driven decisions 📊 meant every action needed a spreadsheet to justify it — including how many coffee pods to order.

Then came the Quarterly Results Miss 📉. Not entirely unexpected, but it stung.

So the Transformation Lead called for The All-Hands Meeting 📣 of all meetings. One where slides were banned and only stories were shared.

And as voices filled the room — from engineers to HR — a shift began to happen...

Now It's Your Turn ! What happens next? Do they overcome resistance? Or spiral into another layer of bureaucracy?


🎮Variant Gameplay Modes
=========================
Sarcastic Mode: Everything goes wrong. Endings are ironic.

Change Management Mode: Players represent different departments trying to tell the best spin on the story.

Consultant vs Internal: Divide into roles (e.g., external consultants vs internal staff) and try to influence the narrative in your favour.
