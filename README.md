These are the card arts for a simple collaborative business storytelling game I cooked up

Admittedly it is a variant of the excellent Once Upon A Time card game but with a business setting as I was getting tired to having to say things like "ok, the troll is the line manager card and the enchanted sword is the spreadsheet -uh wait no, I think it's that's the golden goose"

Once Upon a Business – Gameplay Guide
=====================================
🎯 Objective
Tell a compelling (and possibly chaotic) business-themed story using your hand of cards. Be the first to play all your cards and end the story coherently — or at least hilariously.

🧩 Setup
Shuffle the full deck.
Deal 8 cards to each player (a mix of Characters, Events, Objects, Aspects, and optionally an Ending).
Set aside the remaining deck as a draw pile.

🔄 Turn Structure
Narrate the Story
The first player becomes the storyteller.
Begin a workplace tale (e.g., “At the quarterly town hall, the CFO announced…”).
As you narrate, play cards from your hand that fit naturally into the story.

Play Cards
Cards must be integrated meaningfully — no rattling off cards without context!
You can play as many cards on your turn as you can justify through your narration.

End Your Turn
When you're out of ideas or cards to play, pass to the next player.
The next player must continue the same story, building on what’s come before.

🔁 Interruptions (Optional Rule)
If another player hears a perfect opportunity to play one of their cards (e.g. “Budget Cut” right after someone mentions overspending), they can interrupt.
They must take over the story immediately and continue for at least a few sentences before passing the turn.

🏁 Ending the Story
If a player has an Ending card, they may play it only when the story feels complete.
The story must feel like it wraps up logically — “And that's how we launched the product that saved the company.”
If no Ending card is played, the tale continues until someone runs out of cards and improvises a satisfying close.

🏆 Winning
The first player to use all their cards and bring the story to a fitting close wins.
Alternatively, just enjoy the ride — the real win is laughing through an absurdly realistic corporate saga.
