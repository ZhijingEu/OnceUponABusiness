# OnceUponABusiness
These are the card arts for a simple collaborative business storytelling game I cooked up

Admittedly it is a variant of the excellent Once Upon A Time card game but with a business setting as I was getting tired to having to say things like "ok, the troll is the line manager card and the enchanted sword is the spreadsheet -uh wait no, I think it's that's the golden goose"
